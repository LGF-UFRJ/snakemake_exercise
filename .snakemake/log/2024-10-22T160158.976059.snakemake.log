MissingOutputException in rule create_links in file /home5/attilio/Tarcisio/exercise_snakemake/Snakefile, line 11:
Job 4  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
links/ctrl_R2.fq
Shutting down, this might take some time.
